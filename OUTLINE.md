# Pitch

_What we know a priori:_ 

- The perspective analyses for significantly differing words in each moral foundation between each political party. In other words, we have the scores for each moral foundation, for each party, for each year.
- 3-sentence surrounding contexts of said words
- All debate transcripts

_What are we trying to learn?_

- By looking at the moral scores in each debate, we can get a sense of the differences in how each party appealed to the country for specific issues like gay marriage or the war in Iraq.

_What deeper truth does it reveal?_

- Throughout the article we will examine the moral foundations hypothesis:
> Political liberals construct their moral systems primarily upon two psychological foundations—Harm/care and Fairness/reciprocity—whereas political conservatives construct moral systems more evenly upon five psychological foundations—the same ones as liberals, plus Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/sanctity.

_Does the reader leave the essay feeling differently?_

- Most New York Democrats cannot understand why some Philadelphian union workers support the Republican party. They do not understand the rationale, the logic, the numbers.

# Pudding Rubric

**The idea is worthy of public discourse.** Would a 4-person group debate the premise of the idea for 20 minutes? What assumptions does it challenge? Typical feedback when an idea doesn't fit this criteria: it's “water is wet”.

**There’s a deeper truth.** What deeper truth does it reveal (even if it’s buried deep in the essay)? Does the reader leave the essay feeling differently? Typical feedback when an idea doesn't fit this criteria: it's flat.

**You’re showing, not telling.** Visuals make your argument more accessible and less complex than a thousand-word essay. That detail allows readers to form their own opinions without taking the author’s argument word-for-word (i.e., you’re far more likely to break out of an echo chamber to someone who doesn’t agree with you). Typical feedback when an idea doesn't fit this criteria: TL;DR.
